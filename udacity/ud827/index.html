    <h2>Questions for Investigation</h2>
    <p>

        This experiment will require the use of a standard deck of playing cards. This is a deck of fifty-two cards divided into four suits (spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs), each suit containing thirteen cards (Ace, numbers 2-10, and face cards Jack, Queen,
        and King). You can use either a physical deck of cards for this experiment or you may use a virtual deck of cards such as that found on random.org (<a href="http://www.random.org/playing-cards/">http://www.random.org/playing-cards/</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        <div>
            For the purposes of this task, assign each card a value: The Ace takes a value of 1, numbered cards take the value printed on the card, and the Jack, Queen, and King each take a value of 10.

            The distribution of sample values is almost normal though the distribution of original card values is a negatively skewed one. This is because the distribution of sample means is normal for any population (By The Central Limit Theorem). So is the sum of the sample values which is 3 times of the mean.

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p class="note">
        <div class="title">Central Limit Theorem</div>
        <div>
            The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacementtext annotation indicator, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30). If the population is normal, then the theorem holds true even for samples smaller than 30. In fact, this also holds true even if the population is binomial, provided that min(np, n(1-p))> 5, where n is the sample size and p is the probability of success in the population. This means that we can use the normal probability model to quantify uncertainty when making inferences about a population mean based on the sample mean.
        </div>
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        <div class="title">Sampling without replacement</div>
        <div>
            When the sampling is done without replacement (as in the pumpkin example), then there is a finite correction factor in the formula. Let M denote the population size and n the sample size: \[\sigma_{\bar{y}}=\sqrt{\frac{M-n}{M-1}} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]
            If the population size is large compared to the sample size (population size is more than 20 times the sample size), then the finite correction factor can be ignored and we can use the simpler formula for sampling with replacement.
